***ANDROID HTTP ACCESS INTRO***

IS THERE A NETWORK CONNECTION?
-Before making any network connection, your Android app needs to check if there is a Network Connection
-Requires this permission in the AndroidManifest.xml
    .android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE -> lets your device check for network connection

OTHER PERMISSION NEEDED?
-Must have INTERNET permission
    .android.permission.INTERNET

HTTP Access
-Use Java's HttpURLConnection -- Supported by Google/Android
-Use Apache HttpClient -- Larger but not supported


***HTTP URL CONNECTION***

USING the HttpURLConnection
-Simple Java HTTP class
-The HttpURLConnection and URL classes work hand in hand. Both are part of the "java.net" library.
    .URL: Creates the URL to which you would like to connect
    .HttpURLConnection: represents the connection
-Uses TCP sockets and the standard "java.io" stream classes. This means the I/O calls are blocking
calls and should not be called in the main UI thread.
-We have to make this call in a worker thread and communicate back to the main UI thread using handlers,
and AsyncTask
-Also, connections as any I/O operation might involve exceptions which should be handled (try/catch)
